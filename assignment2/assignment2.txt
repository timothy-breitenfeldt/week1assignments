Assignment Exercise 2:
Write a Java program that enables two people to play the following game. Read the description of the game carefully. 
We start with a pile of chips. Your game will allow for numbers that are odd. 
We get the names of the two players. 
The first player removes between 1 and (number of chips - 1) / 2 from the pile. 
From then on the players alternate turns, removing chips from the pile until it is empty. 
Each player removes at least one chip in each turn, but never more than the half of the number of chips remaining in the pile (if odd number remains, then half of 1 less than number of chips remaining). 
Once the pile becomes empty, the game is over. 
Since the total number of chips is odd, one player will have an even number of chips and the other player will have an odd number of chips. 
The winner of the game is the player with an even number of chips. 
When a game is over, your program should ask whether to play another game. 
If the answer is y or Y, it should play another game; otherwise the program ends. This prompt should occur after each game. 
Note that it is two humans who are playing the game. The computer is merely serving as a referee. 
In other words, you don’t have to worry about determining a strategy for winning the game, nor do you have to worry about programming such a strategy. 
A Sample Run 
Here is a sample run.
