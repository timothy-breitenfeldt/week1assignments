Exercise 4
Date - Time API Questions

1.	 Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?
To store a birthdate, use the LocalDateTime class.
LocalDateTime birthdate = LocalDateTime.of(1994, 3, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0);

2.	 Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?
LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
LocalDate previousThursday = date.with(TemporalAdjusters.previous(DayOfWeek.THURSDAY));

3.	 What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
A zone ID identifys a zone and provides the rules for converting between an Instant and LocalDateTime, where a zone offset is the difference of hours between the timezone and UTC.

4.	 How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?
Converting Instant to ZonedDateTime:
'Instant instant = Instant.now();
ZonedDateTime conversion = instant.atZone(ZoneId.of("Asia/Tokyo"));
Convert ZonedDateTime to Instant:
ZonedDateTime dateTime = dateTime.atZone(ZoneId.of("Asia/Tokyo"));
Instant instant = dateTime.toInstant();
